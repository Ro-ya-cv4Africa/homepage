          <p class="mb-4 lead" align="justify">
            Ro'ya is an Arabic word that means vision to indicate the focus of 
            our community on computer vision datasets, methods and applications that impact our African communities.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 lead" align="justify">
            We aspire to have a diverse community whose members span the whole continent and come from every country in Africa inspired by DLIndaba-X. 
            One of our main beliefs inspired by the DLIndaba community is that “We learn together to build together”. We want to encourage more students 
            and researchers to learn about computer vision fundamentals and its applications which impact Africans. We aim to solve real-world problems 
            that are happening in developing countries, especially the African continent, instead of the current CV research that is focused on developed 
            countries and big tech companies' goals. Our community focus is on a big umbrella of multiple computer vision applications including medical 
            image processing, precision agriculture, remote sensing, traffic monitoring, wildlife monitoring, climate change, AI fairness and others. 
            <!-- Another crucial goal of our community is to encourage the creation of datasets for Africans, and encourage research on learning with limited 
            labeled data and/or limited compute. -->

            This philosophy calls for collaboration and participation and community. It proposes relationality, over individualism for stronger 
            social cohesions towards sustainable communities. It believes we share our successes and one’s personhood is evaluated based on their

                The 1st CV4Africa Workshop will be held  this year co-located with Deep learning Indaba 2023. 
                The workshop will feature invited talks from prominent researchers and practitioners, a challenge and hand-on tutorials. 
                We invite all members of the Computer Vision community to attend the workshop. 
                Computer vision is used in various applications that impact African communities such as, precision
                agriculture, satellite imagery understanding, and medical image processing. It is concerned with the
                mathematical techniques that include both classical and machine learning based methods towards
                achieving the goal of scene and video understanding, and recovering the 3D shape and appearance
                of objects in images. Different sub-tasks in Computer Vision include optical flow, motion detection,
                tracking, segmentation/grouping, and 3D reconstruction among others. Although, it is widely used
                to serve our communities, there exists a current gap in the community based research that lacks
                focus on Computer Vision in Africa. We are mainly inspired by other grassroots initiatives in
                the African community for both natural language processing (Masakhane) and machine learning
                for health (Sisonke Biotik). We aim to launch a community which we call Ro’ya-CV4Africa that
                focuses on Computer Vision research for Africans and by Africans. We believe that this bottom-up
                community based approach is better able to bring researchers from varying parts of the society and
                is inclusive by design. Participatory research, unlike conventional research, defines the research
                process itself within a collaborative and accessible framework to all members of the community.

              <h3> Spatial Apartheid: Constructing a Visual Dataset to Study the Effects of Spatial Apartheid in SA 
              </h3>
             <p align="justify" class="text-black primary-color-icon" style="font-size: 1.2em;">
                Abstract: The lack of ground truth data is usually a barrier when researchers are trying to train machine 
                learning models for real-world applications. Spatial datasets in particular are both complex and 
                expensive to create. In this talk I will be discussing how we constructed a visual dataset that 
                allows us to classify neighbourhoods using machine learning and also allows us to study the effects 
                of spatial segregation in South Africa. While datasets 7 times smaller than ours have cost over $1M 
                to annotate, our dataset was created with highly constrained resources.

                Bio: Raesetje is an AI Research Fellow at the Distributed AI Research(DAIR) institute. Her research focuses 
                on creating ground truth datasets and using machine learning and other computational social science 
                techniques to explore research questions with a societal impact. Her current research uses satellite 
                imagery to study the legacy of spatial apartheid in South Africa, post-Apartheid. Her previous work 
                involved partnering with various stakeholders and using machine learning techniques to study poverty 
                and traffic safety in the urban parts of Nigeria and Jakarta, respectively.

              </h3>
             <p align="justify" class="text-black primary-color-icon" style="font-size: 1.2em;">
                Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) and computer vision (CV) are two rapidly developing fields with the
                potential to revolutionize our understanding of the world. RS provides information about
                objects or phenomena without direct contact, while CV extracts useful data from digital
                images or videos.
                The combination of CV and RS has led to significant advances in a variety of applications,
                including earth observation, natural disaster detection, military surveillance, urban planning,
                crop monitoring, and environmental assessment.
                In the past, the availability of data and computational resources limited the use of CV
                methods for RS. However, recent advances in Deep Learning have made it possible to
                develop more powerful and accurate CV algorithms for RS.
                The role of CV in RS is expected to continue to grow in the future. The availability of large
                datasets, pretrained models, and the development of new sensors will enable the development
                of even more advanced CV algorithms for RS.
                This talk will provide an overview of the past, present, and future of CV for RS. It will
                discuss the challenges and opportunities of this field, and highlight some of the recent
                advances in deep learning for RS, including some work from the Google Accra research lab.

              Bio: Abigail Annkah is a Google AI Research Software Engineer in Ghana. She is passionate
              about using computer vision and optimization to address global challenges, such as bridging
              information gaps in developing regions, improving health, education, and agriculture. She is
              also actively involved in mentorship programs and is always looking for opportunities to
              collaborate with others who share her vision.
              Her undergraduate studies at the University of Ghana, Legon, in Accra provided her with a
              foundation in Mathematics and Statistics. She was awarded a full scholarship for a <a href="https://nexteinstein.org/apply/ammi-applications-2020/"> Master of
                Science in Machine Intelligence</a>  from the <a href="https://nexteinstein.org/">African Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)</a>
              in Kigali, Rwanda. Prior to residency at Google, she worked on several projects, including the
              Application of Image Analysis to Advanced Complex Microbial Images, Spatio-temporal
              modeling and Malaria prediction in Sub-Saharan Africa, and Image Denoising using the
              Diffusion Equations with explicit numerical methods. She worked on mapping built-up
              environments in Africa using satellite imagery during her residency at Google, and is a
              contributor to Google's <a href="https://sites.research.google/open-buildings/">Open Buildings Dataset</a>.
              
              In addition to her technical skills, Abigail is a strong advocate for diversity and inclusion in
              STEM fields. She is an ambassador for <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mindthegapprogram/home">Mind the Gap</a>
              , a Google initiative to encourage female students to pursue careers in STEM, and was mentor for the African Institute of Mathematical

            <h3>The Legacy of Spatial Apartheid Machine Learning Challenge</h3>
            <p>The spatial apartheid dataset has high-resolution satellite images of neighborhoods in South Africa in 2011. 
              It allows the training of a machine learning model that accurately predicts the class of a neighborhood (wealthy area, non-wealthy area, non-residential neighborhood, or background) based on the image. 
              This prediction provides insights on the evolution of spatial apartheid over time and how the demographics and development of neighborhoods in South Africa have changed.
